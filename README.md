# Soundboard
> More like knäckebröd, har jag rätt?

## How to _deal with it?_
 1. Add some sound samples to `public/samples/`.
 2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies _and_ build the assets.
 3. __Optional:__ Run `gulp php-server` to start a PHP server.
 4. __Optional:__ Run `gulp watch` to start watchers that will rebuild assets on change.

Building the soundboard requires having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your system.

## Features
 - Every wav/mp3/ogg you add to `public/samples/` will be glorified instantaneously
 - Responsive search
 - Direct, obfuscated, linking to soundbytes
 - Random button
 - Hold shift to play soundbytes simultaneously
 - Hold control to play soundbytes on a loop

Samples not included!
